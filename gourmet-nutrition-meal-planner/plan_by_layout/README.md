Plan by Layout
===

Here is a different approach that plans meals out by accepting a list
of different labels indicating the desired meal/snack and greedily
selects whatever recipe is available to it that has that label and
that has not already been used during the day. 

```
AT: Anytime meal
at: Anytime snack
PW: Post-workout meal/snack
pW: Pre-workout meal/snack
```

A better version would mark recipes as used for a certain day but
make them available again when planning out following days, ideally
perhaps trying to spread certain meals further away from each other
so you do not eat the same thing every day, and opting to keep
meals that hold over less well when refridgerated early in the week.

Furthermore, certain recipes are more suited at certain times
during the day, such as yoghurt should be enjoyed early in the
day and not later as it contains Vitamin-D.

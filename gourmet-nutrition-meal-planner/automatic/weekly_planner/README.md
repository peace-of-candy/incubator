Plan Multiple Days
===

This solution looks at a set of recipes and their respective number of
servings and treats the product thereof as if that is for how many meals
each respective recipe may be re-used across days. It then takes this
deck of available meals and portions them out, taking care not to re-use
a recipe more than once a day.
